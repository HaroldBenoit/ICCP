# ICCP
ICCP or Integrated Comfort Controller Pipeline is a project created for the ICE Lab at EPFL. 

Its goal is to facilitate the development and research of reinforcement learning based controllers in the context of energy saving and thermal comfort in buildings.

Its written documentation can be found at https://haroldbenoit.github.io/ICCP/.

It integrates particularly well with [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/), the  open-source building energy simulation program.

Although it was developed in the context of civil engineering, `ICCP` can be used for **any development and research** of reinforcement learning based controllers.

This pipeline is best utilized within a Jupyter notebook for an optimal development experience.
