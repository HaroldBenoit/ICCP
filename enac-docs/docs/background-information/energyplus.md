## What's EnergyPlus ?

[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) is an open-source building energy simulation program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model both energy consumption—for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and plug and process loads—and water use in buildings.

## Why EnergyPlus

First, [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) has the advantage of being open-source compared to proprietary solutions such as [TRNSYS](http://www.trnsys.com/). In the world of research, this allows for much easier sharing of knowledge and is inclusive of researchers with low budget.

Second, thanks to being open-source, it has very good integration into Python thanks to projects such as [EnergyPlusToFMU](https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/projects/energyplustofmu), which allows for ease of use and superior performance.
