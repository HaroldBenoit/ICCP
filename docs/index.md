# Official Documentation of the Integrated Comfort Controller Pipeline (ICCP), created by ICE Lab EPFL



`ICCP` or *Integrated Comfort Controller Pipeline* is a project created by the [ICE Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ice/) at EPFL. Its goal is to facilitate the development and research of **reinforcement learning based controllers** in the context of **energy saving** and **thermal comfort** in buildings.

The Github page is available [here](https://github.com/HaroldBenoit/ICCP).

The project integrates particularly well with [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/), the open-source building energy simulation program.

Although it was developed in the context of civil engineering, `ICCP` can be used for **any development and research** of reinforcement learning based controllers.

This pipeline is best utilized within a Jupyter notebook for an optimal development experience.
